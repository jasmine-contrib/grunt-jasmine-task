# grunt-jasmine-task

Grunt task for running jasmine specs.

__Status: stable__  
__[!]__ Apparently there are some problems with getting this to work with PhantomJS 1.5 on both Windows and Linux (see [#2](https://github.com/creynders/grunt-jasmine-task/issues/2), [#4](https://github.com/creynders/grunt-jasmine-task/issues/4)) On Mac it works fine though.

## Getting Started

Make sure you got [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) installed, which is a headless browser. Unfortunately PhantomJS cannot be installed automatically through grunt. [See the grunt faq for installation instructions](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md#why-does-grunt-complain-that-phantomjs-isnt-installed).

__Install this grunt plugin__ next to your project's [grunt.js gruntfile][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-jasmine-task` (if you want install this package from this fork: `npm install https://github.com/rfloriano/grunt-jasmine-task/tarball/master`)

(ie. the plugin is installed locally. If you want to install it globally - which is not recommended - check out the official [grunt documentation][plugin_docs])

__You also need to install the `temporary` module__

Although it is marked as a dependency in the `grunt-jasmine-task` module and automatically is installed together with the jasmine plugin, for some reason it cannot be found, therefore it needs to be installed separately, either as a global or local module.

To install it locally do:
`npm install temporary`

Then __add this line__ to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile at the bottom:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-jasmine-task');
```

Next you need to __create (a) target(s)__ for the jasmine task.

If you want to run one file just add this to the `grunt.initConfig` object 

```javascript
jasmine: {
  all: ['specs/specrunner.html']
},
```
Obviously you need to replace `specs/specrunner.html` with the location of your jasmine spec running html file.

__Since v0.2.1: `errorReporting` config option.__ <a name="error-reporting" href="#error-reporting" title="Link to this section">âš‘</a>

When `errorReporting` is `true` the failing spec description will be outputted to the console, even when run in non-verbose mode.
```javascript
jasmine: {
  all: {
    src:['specs/specrunner.html'],
    errorReporting: true
  }
},
```

__Since v0.2.0: `timeout` config option.__ 
By default the task will fail after 10 seconds of inactivity, however you can override this if you want:

```javascript
jasmine: {
  all: {
    src:['specs/specrunner.html'],
    timeout: 20000 //in milliseconds
  }
},
```
This is useful for async assertions that may require more than 10 seconds to run.

Now you can __run the jasmine task__ with:

```grunt jasmine```

## When specs fail...

By default the jasmine task outputs in non-verbose mode, meaning it will output dots for passed specs and F's for failed ones.
You can see which spec is failing by running the task in verbose mode:  
```grunt jasmine -v```  
or (since v0.2.1) you can turn on reporting for failing specs even in non-verbose mode, see [errorReporting config option](#error-reporting)
